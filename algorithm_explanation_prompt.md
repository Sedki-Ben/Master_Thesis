The system uses WiFi CSI data with 52 subcarriers to predict 2D coordinates (x, y) in an indoor environment.

## Dataset Information
- **Training Data**: 750 samples from 34 reference points in a grid layout
- **Test Data**: 750 samples from 5 intermediate locations (not in training set)
- **Input Features**: 
  - CSI Amplitude: 52 subcarrier amplitude values
  - CSI Phase: 52 subcarrier phase values  
  - RSSI: Received Signal Strength Indicator
- **Target**: 2D coordinates (x, y) in meters
- **Environment**: Indoor laboratory with multipath propagation

## Algorithms to Explain

### 1. Classical Fingerprinting Algorithms

#### k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
**Implementation Details:**
```
Input: Feature vector [rssi, amp_0, amp_1, ..., amp_51] or variants
Algorithm: 
1. Calculate Euclidean distance from test sample to all training samples
2. Find k nearest neighbors in feature space
3. Average the coordinates of these k neighbors
4. Return averaged coordinate as prediction

Variants tested: k ∈ {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, 25}
Best result: k=1 with statistical features (0.904m median error)
```

**Questions to address:**
- How does k-NN work for indoor localization regression?
- Why does distance in CSI feature space correlate with physical distance?
- What are the advantages and limitations of k-NN for this problem?
- How does the choice of k affect localization accuracy?

#### Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)
**Implementation Details:**
```
Mathematical formula: prediction = Σ(w_i * coordinate_i) / Σ(w_i)
where w_i = 1 / (distance_i^power)

Algorithm:
1. Calculate feature space distance to all training samples
2. Compute inverse distance weights with power parameter
3. Weighted average of all training coordinates
4. Higher weights for closer samples in feature space

Power values tested: {1, 2, 3, 4}
Best result: power=1 with RSSI-only (1.779m median error)
```

**Questions to address:**
- How does IDW interpolation work for indoor localization?
- What is the relationship between power parameter and localization behavior?
- Why might IDW work better than k-NN in some cases?
- How does feature space distance relate to physical proximity?

#### Probabilistic Fingerprinting
**Implementation Details:**
```
Training phase:
1. Group samples by reference point location
2. Learn Gaussian distribution (μ, Σ) for each location
3. Apply covariance regularization for numerical stability

Prediction phase:
1. Calculate likelihood P(observation|location) for each reference point
2. Use Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
3. Select location with highest probability

Mathematical basis: Multivariate Gaussian distributions
Best result: Statistical features (1.581m median error)
```

**Questions to address:**
- How does probabilistic fingerprinting model CSI variations?
- What role do Gaussian distributions play in this approach?
- Why is covariance regularization necessary?
- How does MLE work for coordinate prediction?
